* better text handling (including text filters, probably restructure data)
* support for multi-page sorting (using disk sort type method, should remain low-memory)
* faster and lower memory imports (and support for csv and pq)
* support for count(*), distinct, top, etc
* columns with (), other special characters
* proper query planner and join handling
* database cracking (need to decide if planner should dig through each page to see what is useful vs on-the-fly cracking during opcode execution)
* text filters (e.g. ticker == 'SPY')
* group by (having)
* transactions, inserts, etc
